The real difficulty that arises around self-forgiveness is when you come to realise that you still do horrible things even when you are clean. My advice to you is this – be kind – to yourself and to others. It is the simplest of remedies but remarkably effective. A small, bright act of kindness towards another human being is not only a gesture of existential hope, it also reconciles us with the world, and ultimately becomes the path to self-forgiveness.
